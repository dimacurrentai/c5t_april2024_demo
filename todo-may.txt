tests for the most recently pushed actors code

infer type in `.Use` intelligently, via SFINAE
maybe even introduce `.Use` with multiple interfaces?

also infer types for `EMIT` / `SUBSCRIBE`

.Forget() in storage, for the whole collection and for the key
with tests

think of `IRequest` (or `IHasRequest`) as one of the standard interfaces?

inject the instance of the lifetime mgr into `dlib`-first code?
